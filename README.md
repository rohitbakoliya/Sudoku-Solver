# Sudoku-Solver
Languages â€“ C and JAVA
It is only for solving symmetrical sudokus.
The objective of sudoku solver is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub grids (also called boxes) that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
 In which we take input as 1 to 9 for clues and 0 for empty squares. Minimum 2 or 3 clues are required in every 3x3 sub grids (boxes) and 25 clues are required in entire 9x9 gird for a unique solution of sudoku.
Rules of solving sudoku are similar as usual. Little change is that we use 0 for showing empty space.
However, Unique solution can find for minimum 17 clues. But less clues makes it too harder and very complex in C algorithm so there we use more than 17 make it simpler.
